## Hey there, I'm Charles ðŸ‘‹

I work in sales at Aikido Security, where we help devs ship secure code without slowing them down.

ðŸ’¬ Always happy to chat about software security.

ðŸ‘¾ Aikido scans everything from code to cloud (15+ ways). Our AI cuts through the noise, catches issues early and reduces false positives by 85% â€” so you can spend less time triaging and more time shipping.
